=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides various tools for working with an
L<OpenAPI Specification v3.1 document|https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#openapi-document> within
your application. The JSON Schema evaluator is fully specification-compliant; the OpenAPI evaluator
aims to be but some features are not yet available. My belief is that missing features are better
than features that seem to work but actually cut corners for simplicity.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR ARGUMENTS

If construction of the object is not successful, for example the document has a syntax error, the
call to C<new()> will throw an exception. Be careful about examining this exception, for it might be
a L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Result> object, which has a boolean overload of false when it contains
errors! But you never do C<if ($@) { ... }>, right?

=head2 openapi_uri

The URI that identifies the OpenAPI document.
Ignored if L</openapi_document> is provided.

If it is not absolute, it is resolved at runtime against the request's C<Host> header (when available)
and scheme (e.g. C<https>).

=head2 openapi_schema

The data structure describing the OpenAPI v3.1 document (as specified at
L<https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0>). Ignored if L</openapi_document> is provided.

=head2 openapi_document

The L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Document::OpenAPI> document that holds the OpenAPI information to be
used for validation. If it is not provided to the constructor, then both L</openapi_uri> and
L</openapi_schema> B<MUST> be provided, and L</evaluator> will also be used if provided.

=head2 evaluator

The L<JSON::Schema::Modern> object to use for all URI resolution and JSON Schema evaluation.
Ignored if L</openapi_document> is provided. Optional.

=head1 ACCESSORS/METHODS

=head2 openapi_uri

The URI that identifies the OpenAPI document.

=head2 openapi_schema

The data structure describing the OpenAPI document. See L<the specification/https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0>.

=head2 openapi_document

The L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Document::OpenAPI> document that holds the OpenAPI information to be
used for validation.

=head2 document_get

  my $parameter_data = $openapi->document_get('/paths/~1foo~1{foo_id}/get/parameters/0');

Fetches the subschema at the provided JSON pointer.
Proxies to L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Document::OpenAPI/get>.
This is not recursive (does not follow C<$ref> chains) -- for that, use
C<< $openapi->recursive_get(Mojo::URL->new->fragment($json_pointer)) >>, see
L</recursive_get>.

=head2 evaluator

The L<JSON::Schema::Modern> object to use for all URI resolution and JSON Schema evaluation.

=head2 validate_request

  $result = $openapi->validate_request(
    $request,
    # optional second argument can contain any combination of:
    my $options = {
      path_template => '/foo/{arg1}/bar/{arg2}',
      operation_id => 'my_operation_id',
      path_captures => { arg1 => 1, arg2 => 2 },
      method => 'get',
    },
  );

Validates an L<HTTP::Request>, L<Plack::Request>, L<Catalyst::Request> or L<Mojo::Message::Request>
object against the corresponding OpenAPI v3.1 document, returning a
L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Result> object.

The second argument is an optional hashref that contains extra information about the request,
corresponding to the values expected by L</find_path> below. It is populated with some information
about the request:
save it and pass it to a later L</validate_response> (corresponding to a response for this request)
to improve performance.

=head2 validate_response

  $result = $openapi->validate_response(
    $response,
    {
      path_template => '/foo/{arg1}/bar/{arg2}',
      request => $request,
    },
  );

Validates an L<HTTP::Response>, L<Plack::Response>, L<Catalyst::Response> or L<Mojo::Message::Response>
object against the corresponding OpenAPI v3.1 document, returning a
L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Result> object.

The second argument is an optional hashref that contains extra information about the request
corresponding to the response, as in L</find_path>.

C<request> is also accepted as a key in the hashref, representing the original request object that
corresponds to this response (as not all HTTP libraries link to the request in the response object).

=head2 find_path

  $result = $self->find_path($options);

Uses information in the request to determine the relevant parts of the OpenAPI specification.
C<request> should be provided if available, but additional data can be used instead
(which is populated by earlier L</validate_request> or L</find_path> calls to the same request).

The single argument is a hashref that contains information about the request. Possible values
include:

=over 4

=item *

C<request>: the object representing the HTTP request. Should be provided when available.

=item *

C<path_template>: a string representing the request URI, with placeholders in braces (e.g. C</pets/{petId}>); see L<https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#paths-object>.

=item *

C<operation_id>: a string corresponding to the L<operationId|https://swagger.io/docs/specification/paths-and-operations/#operationid> at a particular path-template and HTTP location under C</paths>

=item *

C<path_captures>: a hashref mapping placeholders in the path to their actual values in the request URI

=item *

C<method>: the HTTP method used by the request (used case-insensitively)

=back

All of these values are optional (unless C<request> is omitted), and will be derived from the
request URI as needed (albeit less
efficiently than if they were provided). All passed-in values MUST be consistent with each other and
the request URI.

When successful, the options hash will be populated with keys C<path_template>, C<path_captures>,
C<method>, and C<operation_id>,
and the return value is true.
When not successful, the options hash will be populated with key C<errors>, an arrayref containing
a L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Error> object, and the return value is false. Other values may also be
populated if they can be successfully calculated.

In addition, these values are populated in the options hash (when available):

* C<path_item_uri>: a URI indicating the document location of the path-item object for the
  request, after following any references (usually something under C</paths/>, but may be in another
  document). Use C<< $openapi->evaluator->get($uri) >> to fetch this content (see
  L<JSON::Schema::Modern/get>). Note that this is the same as
  C<< $openapi->recursive_get(Mojo::URL->new->fragment(JSON::Schema::Modern::Utilities::jsonp('/paths', $options->{path_template}))) >>.
* C<request> (not necessarily what was passed in: this is always a L<Mojo::Message::Request>)

You can find the associated operation object by using either C<path_item_uri> and the HTTP method,
or by calling C<< $openapi->openapi_document->get_operationId_path($operation_id) >>
(see L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Document::OpenAPI/get_operationId_path>).

Note that the L<C</servers>|https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#server-object> section of the
OpenAPI document is not used for path matching at this time, for either scheme and host matching nor
path prefixes. For now, if you use a path prefix in C<servers> entries you will need to add this to
the path templates under `/paths`.

=head2 recursive_get

Given a uri or uri-reference, get the definition at that location, following any C<$ref>s along the
way. Include the expected definition type
(one of C<schema>, C<response>, C<parameter>, C<example>, C<request-body>, C<header>,
C<security-scheme>, C<link>, C<callbacks>, or C<path-item>)
for validation of the entire reference chain.

Returns the data in scalar context, or a tuple of the data and the canonical URI of the
referenced location in list context.

If the provided location is relative, the main openapi document is used for the base URI.
If you have a local json pointer you want to resolve, you can turn it into a uri-reference by
prepending C<#>.

  my $schema = $openapi->recursive_get('#/components/parameters/Content-Encoding', 'parameter');

  # starts with a JSON::Schema::Modern object (TODO)
  my $schema = $js->recursive_get('https:///openapi_doc.yaml#/components/schemas/my_object')
  my $schema = $js->recursive_get('https://localhost:1234/my_spec#/$defs/my_object')

=head2 canonical_uri

An accessor that delegates to L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Document/canonical_uri>.

=head2 schema

An accessor that delegates to L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Document/schema>.

=head2 get_media_type

An accessor that delegates to L<JSON::Schema::Modern/get_media_type>.

=head2 add_media_type

A setter that delegates to L<JSON::Schema::Modern/add_media_type>.

=head1 ON THE USE OF JSON SCHEMAS

Embedded JSON Schemas, through the use of the C<schema> keyword, are fully draft2020-12-compliant,
as per the spec, and implemented with L<JSON::Schema::Modern>. Unless overridden with the use of the
L<jsonSchemaDialect|https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#specifying-schema-dialects> keyword, their
metaschema is L<https://spec.openapis.org/oas/3.1/dialect/base>, which allows for use of the
OpenAPI-specific keywords (C<discriminator>, C<xml>, C<externalDocs>, and C<example>), as defined in
L<the specification/https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#schema-object>. Format validation is turned
B<on>, and the use of content* keywords is off (see
L<JSON::Schema::Modern/validate_content_schemas>).

References (with the C<$ref>) keyword may reference any position within the entire OpenAPI document;
as such, json pointers are relative to the B<root> of the document, not the root of the subschema
itself. References to other documents are also permitted, provided those documents have been loaded
into the evaluator in advance (see L<JSON::Schema::Modern/add_schema>).

Values are generally treated as strings for the purpose of schema evaluation. However, if the top
level of the schema contains C<"type": "number"> or C<"type": "integer">, then the value will be
(attempted to be) coerced into a number before being passed to the JSON Schema evaluator.
Type coercion will B<not> be done if the C<type> keyword is omitted.
This lets you use numeric keywords such as C<maximum> and C<multipleOf> in your schemas.
It also resolves inconsistencies that can arise when request and response objects are created
manually in a test environment (as opposed to being parsed from incoming network traffic) and can
therefore inadvertently contain perlish numbers rather than strings.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

All message validation is done using L<Mojolicious> objects (L<Mojo::Message::Request> and
L<Mojo::Message::Response>). If messages of other types are passed, conversion is done on a
best-effort basis, but since different implementations have different levels of adherence to the RFC
specs, some validation errors may occur e.g. if a certain required header is missing on the
original. For best results in validating real messages from the network, parse them directly into
Mojolicious messages (see L<Mojo::Message/parse>).

Only certain permutations of OpenAPI documents are supported at this time:

=over 4

=item *

for path parameters, only C<style: simple> and C<explode: false> is supported

=item *

for query parameters, only C<style: form> and C<explode: true> is supported, only the first value of each parameter name is considered, and C<allowEmptyValue> and C<allowReserved> are not checked

=item *

cookie parameters are not checked at all yet

=item *

C<application/x-www-form-urlencoded> and C<multipart/*> messages are not yet supported
