=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides various tools for working with an
L<OpenAPI Specification v3.1 or v3.2 document|https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest#openapi-document> within
your application. The JSON Schema evaluator is fully specification-compliant; the OpenAPI evaluator
aims to be but some features are not yet available.

=for Pod::Coverage BUILDARGS FREEZE THAW

=for stopwords schema jsonSchemaDialect metaschema subschema perlish operationId openapi Mojolicious

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR ARGUMENTS

If construction of the object is not successful, for example the document has a syntax error, the
call to C<new()> will throw an exception, which will likely be a L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Result>
object containing details.

Unless otherwise noted, these are also available as read-only accessors.

=head2 openapi_uri

Optional.

The URI that identifies the OpenAPI document; an alias to C<< ->openapi_document->canonical_uri >>.
See L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Document::OpenAPI/canonical_uri>.
Ignored if L</openapi_document> is provided.

This URI will be used at runtime to resolve relative URIs used in
the OpenAPI document, such as for C<jsonSchemaDialect> or C<servers url> values and C<$ref>
locations, as well as used for locations in L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Result> objects (see below).

The value of C<$self> in the document (if present) is resolved against this value.
It is strongly recommended that this resulting URI is absolute.

=head2 openapi_schema

The data structure describing the OpenAPI document (as specified at
L<https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest>; an alias to C<< ->openapi_document->schema >>.
See L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Document::OpenAPI/schema>.
Ignored if L</openapi_document> is provided, otherwise required.

=head2 openapi_document

The L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Document::OpenAPI> document that holds the OpenAPI information to be
used for validation. If it is not provided to the constructor, then
L</openapi_schema> B<MUST> be provided, and L</evaluator> will also be used if provided.

=head2 evaluator

The L<JSON::Schema::Modern> object to use for all URI resolution and JSON Schema evaluation.
Optional (a default is constructed when omitted).

This must be prepared in advance if custom metaschemas are to be used, as the evaluator is what
holds the information about all available schemas (which are used by keywords such as
C<jsonSchemaDialect> and C<$ref>.

=head2 debug

Boolean; defaults to false (can also be set via C<$DEBUG>).

When set, useful diagnostic information is stored in the C<$options> hash used in public methods
described below.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 document_get

  my $parameter_data = $openapi->document_get('/paths/~1foo~1{foo_id}~1bar~1%7Bbar_id%7D/post/parameters/0');

Fetches the subschema at the provided JSON pointer from the main OpenAPI document.
Proxies to L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Document::OpenAPI/get>.
This is not recursive (does not follow C<$ref> chains) -- for that, use
C<< $openapi->recursive_get(Mojo::URL->new->fragment($json_pointer)) >>, see
L</recursive_get>.

=head2 validate_request

  $result = $openapi->validate_request(
    $request,
    # optional second argument can contain any combination of these keys+values:
    my $options = {
      path_template => '/foo/{foo_id}/bar/{bar_id}',
      operation_id => 'my_foo_request',
      path_captures => { foo_id => 'abc', bar_id => 2 },
      method => 'POST',
    },
  );

Validates an L<HTTP::Request>, L<Plack::Request>, L<Catalyst::Request>,
L<Dancer2::Core::Request> or L<Mojo::Message::Request>
object against the corresponding OpenAPI document, returning a
L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Result> object.

Absolute URIs in the result object are constructed by resolving the openapi document path against
the L</openapi_uri> (which is derived from the document's C<$self> keyword as well as the URI
provided to the document constructor).

The second argument is an optional hashref that contains extra information about the request,
corresponding to the values expected by L</find_path_item> below. The method populates the hashref
with some information about the request:
save it and pass it to a later L</validate_response> call (that corresponds to a response for this request)
to improve performance.

=head2 validate_response

  $result = $openapi->validate_response(
    $response,
    {
      request => $request,
    },
  );

Validates an L<HTTP::Response>, L<Plack::Response>, L<Catalyst::Response>,
L<Dancer2::Core::Response> or L<Mojo::Message::Response>
object against the corresponding OpenAPI document, returning a
L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Result> object.

Absolute URIs in the result object are constructed by resolving the openapi document path against
the L</openapi_uri> (which is derived from the document's C<$self> keyword as well as the URI
provided to the document constructor).

The second argument is an optional hashref that contains extra information about the request
corresponding to the response, as in L</validate_request> and L</find_path_item>.

C<request> in the hashref represents the original request object that
corresponds to this response, which can be used to find the appropriate section of the document if
other values (such as C<operationId>) are not known.

In addition, this values are populated into the hashref:

=for :items * C<response>: the L<Mojo::Message::Response> object that was provided or converted from the
  provided response

=head2 find_path_item

=for Pod::Coverage find_path

  $result = $self->find_path_item($options);

Finds the appropriate L<path-item|https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest#path-item-object> entry
in the OpenAPI document corresponding to a request. Called
internally by both L</validate_request> and L</validate_response>.

The single argument is a hashref that contains information about the request. Various combinations
of values can be provided; possible values are:

=over 4

=item *

C<request>: the object representing the HTTP request. Supported types are: L<HTTP::Request>, L<Plack::Request>, L<Catalyst::Request>, L<Dancer2::Core::Request>, L<Mojo::Message::Request>. Converted to a L<Mojo::Message::Request> (the value in this hashref will be overwritten).

=item *

C<uri>: the URI of the HTTP request. Converted from any string-compatible type to a L<Mojo::URL>.

=item *

C<method>: the HTTP method used by the request (case-sensitive)

=item *

C<path_template>: a string representing the (possibly partial) path portion of the request URI, with placeholders in braces (e.g. C</pets/{petId}>); see L<https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest#paths-object>.

=item *

C<operation_id>: a string corresponding to the L<operationId|https://learn.openapis.org/specification/paths.html#the-endpoints-list> at a particular path-template and HTTP location under C</paths>. In the case of ambiguous matches (such as the possibility of more than one C<path_template> matching the request URI), providing this value will serve to unambiguously state which path-item and operation are intended, and is also more efficient as not all path-item entries need to be searched to find a match.

=item *

C<path_captures>: a hashref mapping placeholders in the path template to their actual values in the request URI; these will be url-unescaped

=back

All values are optional, and will be derived from each other as needed (albeit less
efficiently than if they were provided). All passed-in values MUST be consistent with each other and
the request or the return value from this method is false and appropriate errors will be included
in the C<$options> hash.

When successful, the options hash will be populated (or updated) with all the above keys,
and the return value is true.
When not successful, the options hash will be populated with key C<errors>, an arrayref containing
a L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Error> object, and the return value is false.

In addition, these values are also populated in the options hash (when available):

=for stopwords punycode

=over 4

=item *

C<uri_captures>: a hashref mapping placeholders in the entire uri template (server url plus path template) to their actual values in the request URI; these will be url-unescaped (for values coming from the path) and punycode-decoded (for values coming from the host).

=item *

C<operation_uri>: a URI indicating the document location of the operation object for the request, after following any references (usually something under C</paths/>, but may be in another document). Use C<< $openapi->evaluator->get($uri) >> to fetch this content (see L<JSON::Schema::Modern/get>). Note that this is the same as:

    $openapi->document_get(Mojo::URL->new($openapi->openapi_uri)->fragment($path_to_operation);

(See the L<documentation for an operation|https://learn.openapis.org/specification/paths.html#the-endpoints-list>
or in
L<§4.10 of the specification|https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest#operation-object>.)

=item *

C<debug>: when C<$OpenAPI::Modern::DEBUG> or L</debug> is set on the OpenAPI::Modern object, additional diagnostic information is stored here in separate keys:

=over 4

=item *

C<uri_patterns>: an arrayref of patterns that were attempted to be matched against the URI, in match order

=back

=back

You can find the associated operation object in the OpenAPI document by using either C<operation_uri>,
or by calling C<< $openapi->openapi_document->operationId_path($operation_id) >>
(see L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Document::OpenAPI/operationId_path>) (note that the latter will
be changed in a subsequent release, in order to support operations existing in other documents).

=head2 recursive_get

Given a uri or uri-reference (resolved against the main OpenAPI document's C<canonical_uri>),
get the definition at that location, following any C<$ref>s along the
way. Include the expected definition type
(one of C<schema>, C<response>, C<parameter>, C<example>, C<request-body>, C<header>,
C<security-scheme>, C<link>, C<callbacks>, or C<path-item>)
for validation of the entire reference chain.

Returns the data in scalar context, or a tuple of the data and the canonical URI of the
referenced location in list context.

If the provided location is relative, the main openapi document is used for the base URI.
If you have a local json pointer you want to resolve, you can turn it into a uri-reference by
prepending C<#> and url-encoding it, e.g. C<< Mojo::URL->new->fragment($jsonp) >>.

  my $param = $openapi->recursive_get('#/components/parameters/Content-Encoding', 'parameter');
  my $operation_schema = $openapi->recursive_get(Mojo::URL->new('https://example.com/api.json')
    ->fragment(jsonp(qw(/paths /foo/{foo_id} get requestBody content application/json schema)));

  # starts with a JSON::Schema::Modern object (TODO)
  my $schema = $js->recursive_get('https:///openapi_doc.yaml#/components/schemas/my_object')
  my $schema = $js->recursive_get('https://localhost:1234/my_spec#/$defs/my_object')

=head2 canonical_uri

An accessor that delegates to L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Document/canonical_uri>.

=head2 schema

An accessor that delegates to L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Document/schema>.

=head2 get_media_type

An accessor that delegates to L<JSON::Schema::Modern/get_media_type>.

=head2 add_media_type

A setter that delegates to L<JSON::Schema::Modern/add_media_type>.

=head1 CACHING

=for stopwords preforking

Very large OpenAPI documents may take a noticeable time to be
loaded and parsed. You can reduce the impact to your preforking application by loading all necessary
documents at startup, and impact can be further reduced by saving objects to cache and then
reloading them (perhaps by using a timestamp or checksum to determine if a fresh reload is needed).

  sub get_openapi (...) {
    my $serialized_file = Mojo::File->new($serialized_filename);
    my $openapi_file = Mojo::File->new($openapi_filename);
    my $openapi;
    if ($serialized_file->stat->mtime < $openapi_file->stat->mtime)) {
      $openapi = OpenAPI::Modern->new(
        openapi_uri => '/api',
        openapi_schema => decode_json($openapi_file->slurp_raw), # your openapi document
      );
      $openapi->evaluator->add_schema(decode_json(...));  # any other needed schemas
      my $frozen = Sereal::Encoder->new({ freeze_callbacks => 1 })->encode($openapi);
      $serialized_file->spew_raw($frozen);
    }
    else {
      my $frozen = $serialized_file->slurp_raw;
      $openapi = Sereal::Decoder->new->decode($frozen);
    }

    # add custom format validations, media types and encodings here
    $openapi->evaluator->add_media_type(...);

    return $openapi;
  }

See also L<JSON::Schema::Modern/CACHING>.

=head1 BUNDLED SCHEMA DOCUMENTS

This distribution comes bundled with all the metaschema documents you need to build your
application, or build custom schemas on top of. These can be referenced via constants in
L<OpenAPI::Modern::Utilities> if you are building complex cross-referencing documents.
We always use the latest versions of the documents that are published for each minor specification
version; if you need earlier versions (but you should ask yourself why), you can find them at
L<https://spec.openapis.org/#openapi-specification-schemas>.

The default metaschema used by this tool does not permit the use of C<$schema> keywords
in subschemas (unless the value is equal to the default OAS dialect), but a more permissive
dialect is also available (or you can define your own), which you declare by providing the
L<C<jsonSchemaDialect>|https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest#openapi-object> property in your OpenAPI
Document.

The schemas are also available under the URIs C<< s/<date>/latest/ >> so you don't have to change your
code or configurations to keep pace with internal changes.

An even stricter schema and dialect are available, via the metaschema_uri
C<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karenetheridge/OpenAPI-Modern/master/share/3.2/strict-schema.json>,
which treats the `format` keyword as an assertion, and also prevents any unknown keywords from being
used in JSON Schemas. This is useful to avoid
spelling mistakes from going unnoticed and resulting in false positive results.

The OpenAPI v3.0 schema document is also available, for use in validating v3.0.x OpenAPI
descriptions, but parsing of the description (e.g. for use in request and response validation) is
not supported. It can be used directly as a schema (e.g. by using its URI in a C<$schema> or C<$ref>
keyword) after calling L<JSON::Schema::Modern::Utilities/load_cached_document>.

=head1 ON THE USE OF JSON SCHEMAS

Embedded JSON Schemas, through the use of the C<schema> keyword, are fully draft2020-12-compliant,
as per the spec, and implemented with L<JSON::Schema::Modern>. Unless overridden with the use of the
L<jsonSchemaDialect|https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest#specifying-schema-dialects> keyword, their
metaschema is the "dialect" schema listed at L<https://spec.openapis.org/oas/#schema-iterations>, which allows for use of the
OpenAPI-specific keywords (C<discriminator>, C<xml>, C<externalDocs>, and C<example>), as defined in
L<the specification|https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest#schema-object>. Format validation is turned
B<on>, and the use of content* keywords is off (see
L<JSON::Schema::Modern/validate_content_schemas>).

References (with the C<$ref>) keyword may reference any position within the entire OpenAPI document;
as such, json pointers are relative to the B<root> of the document, not the root of the subschema
itself. References to other documents are also permitted, provided those documents have been loaded
into the evaluator in advance (see L<JSON::Schema::Modern/add_schema>).

Values are generally treated as strings for the purpose of schema evaluation. However, if the top
level of the schema contains C<"type": "number"> or C<"type": "integer">, then the value will be
(attempted to be) coerced into a number before being passed to the JSON Schema evaluator.
Type coercion will B<not> be done if the C<type> keyword is omitted.
This lets you use numeric keywords such as C<maximum> and C<multipleOf> in your schemas.
It also resolves inconsistencies that can arise when request and response objects are created
manually in a test environment (as opposed to being parsed from incoming network traffic) and can
therefore inadvertently contain perlish numbers rather than strings.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

All message validation is done using L<Mojolicious> objects (L<Mojo::Message::Request> and
L<Mojo::Message::Response>). If messages of other types are passed, conversion is done on a
best-effort basis, but since different implementations have different levels of adherence to the RFC
specs, some validation errors may occur e.g. if a certain required header is missing on the
original. For best results in validating real messages from the network, parse them directly into
Mojolicious messages (see L<Mojo::Message/parse>).

Only certain permutations of OpenAPI documents are supported at this time:

=over 4

=item *

for path parameters, only C<style: simple> and C<explode: false> is supported

=item *

for query parameters, only C<style: form> and C<explode: true> is supported, only the first value of each parameter name is considered, and C<allowEmptyValue> and C<allowReserved> are not checked

=item *

cookie parameters are not checked at all yet

=item *

C<multipart/*> messages are not yet supported

=item *

OpenAPI descriptions must be contained in a single document; while C<$ref>erences to other documents (such as within a C</components> structure) are supported, C</paths> entries in other documents are not considered at this time.

=item *

The use of C<$ref> within a path-item object is only allowed when not adjacent to any other path-item properties (C<parameters>, C<servers>, request methods)

=item *

Security schemes in the OpenAPI description, and the use of any C<Authorization> headers in requests, are not currently supported.
